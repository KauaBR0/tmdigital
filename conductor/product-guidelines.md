# Product Guidelines - tmDigital Sales Lead Manager

## Tone and Voice
- **Professional & Efficient:** The interface should use clear, concise language focused on business productivity. Avoid fluff and ensure instructions are direct and actionable.

## Visual Identity
- **Modern & Clean:** Utilize ample white space, crisp typography (e.g., Roboto or Inter), and a modern layout.
- **UI Framework:** Leverage PrimeNG's Material or Tailwind themes to ensure a polished and consistent look.
- **Color Palette:** Focus on professional blues and greens that reflect both the "digital" and "agricultural" nature of the business.

## Brand Messaging
- **"Data-Driven Growth":** The UI should highlight metrics and insights that demonstrate how the tool helps the distributor expand their market share.

## Interaction Principles
- **Structured Workflows:** Use multi-step forms or clear wizards for registering complex entities like Leads and Rural Properties to minimize errors.
- **Interactive Visuals:** Dashboard elements (charts, summaries) should be interactive, allowing users to drill down or filter lists based on the visual data.

## Localization and Accessibility
- **Portuguese (BR):** All labels, messages, and date/currency formats must be strictly in Brazilian Portuguese.
- **Responsive Design:** The application must be fully responsive, ensuring a high-quality experience on desktops, laptops, and tablets used by sales teams in the field.
